We had hands-on experience with all that we've learned so far which allowed us to bring our ideas to fruition and taught us how to troubleshoot. We also learned that working as a team is way better than working solo.
Having worked through several merge conflicts, we have a better understanding of git. But most us aren't quite confident in fixing git issues, more practice will do us good.
For those who want to work on a similar project: Make sure to pull the latest version of the project before pushing anything to github. Communicate with teammates to avoid git conflicts. Don't get disheartened by not finding a good API at the start.
